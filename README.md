# dvwa CSRF example

The aim of this project is to show how the CSRF vulnerability is exploited and to create a simple solution. It is using the DVWA web application as a backbone for the project. Everything that is changed has a copy of the **ORIGINAL** files.

## WARNING!

Damn Vulnerable Web Application is damn vulnerable! **Do not upload it to your hosting provider's public html folder or any Internet facing servers**, as they will be compromised. It is recommended using a virtual machine (such as [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/)), which is set to NAT networking mode. Inside a guest machine, you can download and install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html) for the web server and database.

## Installation

**Please make sure your config/config.inc.php file exists. Only having a config.inc.php.dist will not be sufficient and you'll have to edit it to suit your environment and rename it to config.inc.php. [Windows may hide the trailing extension.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/865219/how-to-show-or-hide-file-name-extensions-in-windows-explorer)**

### Windows + XAMPP

The easiest way to install DVWA is to download and install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html) if you do not already have a web server setup.

XAMPP is a very easy to install Apache Distribution for Linux, Solaris, Windows and Mac OS X. The package includes the Apache web server, MySQL, PHP, Perl, a FTP server and phpMyAdmin.

XAMPP can be downloaded from:
https://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html

Simply unzip dvwa.zip, place the unzipped files in your public html folder, then point your browser to: http://127.0.0.1/dvwa/setup.php

### Linux Packages

If you are using a Debian based Linux distribution, you will need to install the following packages _(or their equivalent)_:

`apt-get -y install apache2 mysql-server php php-mysqli php-gd libapache2-mod-php`

### Database Setup

To set up the database, simply click on the `Setup DVWA` button in the main menu, then click on the `Create / Reset Database` button. This will create / reset the database for you with some data in.

If you receive an error while trying to create your database, make sure your database credentials are correct within `./config/config.inc.php`. *This differs from config.inc.php.dist, which is an example file.*

The variables are set to the following by default:

```php
$_DVWA[ 'db_user' ] = 'root';
$_DVWA[ 'db_password' ] = 'p@ssw0rd';
$_DVWA[ 'db_database' ] = 'dvwa';
```

Note, if you are using MariaDB rather than MySQL (MariaDB is default in Kali), then you can't use the database root user, you must create a new database user. To do this, connect to the database as the root user then use the following commands:

```mysql
mysql> create database dvwa;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> grant all on dvwa.* to dvwa@localhost identified by 'SuperSecretPassword99';
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.01 sec)

mysql> flush privileges;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

You will then need to update the config file, the new entries will look like this:

```php
$_DVWA[ 'db_user' ] = 'dvwa';
$_DVWA[ 'db_password' ] = 'SuperSecretPassword99';
$_DVWA[ 'db_database' ] = 'dvwa';
```

### Other Configuration

Depending on your Operating System, as well as version of PHP, you may wish to alter the default configuration. The location of the files will be different on a per-machine basis.

**Folder Permissions**:

* `./hackable/uploads/` - Needs to be writable by the web service (for File Upload).
* `./external/phpids/0.6/lib/IDS/tmp/phpids_log.txt` - Needs to be writable by the web service (if you wish to use PHPIDS).

**PHP configuration**:

* `allow_url_include = on` - Allows for Remote File Inclusions (RFI)   [[allow_url_include](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/filesystem.configuration.php#ini.allow-url-include)]
* `allow_url_fopen = on` -  Allows for Remote File Inclusions (RFI)    [[allow_url_fopen](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/filesystem.configuration.php#ini.allow-url-fopen)]
* `safe_mode = off` - (If PHP <= v5.4) Allows for SQL Injection (SQLi) [[safe_mode](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/features.safe-mode.php)]
* `magic_quotes_gpc = off` - (If PHP <= v5.4) Allows for SQL Injection (SQLi) [[magic_quotes_gpc](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/security.magicquotes.php)]
* `display_errors = off` - (Optional) Hides PHP warning messages to make it less verbose [[display_errors](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.display-errors)]

**File: `config/config.inc.php`**:

* `$_DVWA[ 'recaptcha_public_key' ]` & `$_DVWA[ 'recaptcha_private_key' ]` - These values need to be generated from: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create

### Default Credentials

**Default username = `admin`**

**Default password = `password`**

_...can easily be brute forced ;)_
